# Handbook

WidgetsAcademy company handbook

## Core values

Our goal is to empower developers to build awesome apps, packages und plugins using Flutter.
Instead of creating new tools to use, we want to lower the barrier of entry to create packages - our strong suit is teaching, speaking figuratively, we want to help build a strong foundation so that others can build skyscrapers.

Occasionally we may be building "proof of concept" skyscrapers ourselves to raise the awareness of what is possible.

## Business model

We provide professional training for Flutter development and anything touching this domain. For the time being this means all of our trainings will be "closed" source and available only to paying customers. We are still in an early stage and we would like to open source our curriculum in the future, as we are an early stage company this just is not viable yet.

## Giving back

While our business model currently closed source, we still aim at giving back to the community. As our core business is creating tutorials, examples and exercises we are uniquely qualified to improve the the documentation of open source packages which don't have the manpower, focus or interest in creating this.

When contributing, we will be focussing only on adding documentation and examples and will refrain from changing anything else even if it seems to be an "obvious" fix. Any such fixes will be contributed in separate pull-requests to make it easy for the maintainers to accept our doc contributions.
